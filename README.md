# project-mate
Basically, imagine a platform that easily enables people to meet each other and create virtual video chat rooms, like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber

If the video is limited to "vtuber" like streams, the platform could stream voice and motion inputs, and render the virtual character to sync up with the audio on the client, and avoid a full resolution video stream to be exchaned.

All of the specifications for the different formats, protocols, tools associated with the platform would be open source and ultimately governed by the community as a collective.

Whether that is by appointing a chain of command, or by holding votes or elections, is still to be determined and discussed.

The name of this project ("mate") was chosen for a private reason. The name was not chosen because it is an anagram of a word spelled "M",   "E",    "T",  "A".
